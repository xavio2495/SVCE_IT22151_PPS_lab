### author: Antony Xavio Immanuel

## So yeah, basically this is a repository for all those guys who can't understand wtf is that teacher trying to say... Well, you can learn or mug up the programs here. If you have a doubt or some error which you can't solve, feel free to ask me in college.

## I did try my best to provide a detailed explanation, but some might be a bit sarcastic, hope you wont mind that.

## Anyways, good luck, hope this repository is at least a tad bit helpful for you and your friends
