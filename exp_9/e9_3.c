/* Being  a  question  of  syllabus  in  CAT,  Prof.  Selvi  wishes  to  award  an 
addition  of x  marks  to  all  students  of  her  class.  Write  a  C  program  that 
achieves  this  using  a  function  of  prototype  void 
grace_marks(marks[],  n,  int  x).  Write  functions 
get_marks(marks[], n) and print_marks(marks[], n) to read 
and print marks*/
