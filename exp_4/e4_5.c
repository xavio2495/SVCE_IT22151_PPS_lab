/*Assume SVCE mark entry portal has facility to enter the ESE marks and its 
equivalent  in  words  by  the  teacher.  However,  the  teachers  wish  that  it 
would be great if  the marks in number are converted to  their words by 
the software. Can you please develop a C program for the same? Marks 
range from 0 -100.  Sample: 81 â€“ Eight One*/
